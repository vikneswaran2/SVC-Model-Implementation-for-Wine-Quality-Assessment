# SVC-Model-Implementation-for-Wine-Quality-Assessment
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classify data by finding an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. For our Wine Quality project, this means robustly separating different quality levels.

Key Concepts:

Margin Maximization: Creates a wide, robust decision boundary, improving generalization for diverse wine samples.

Support Vectors: Only critical, "boundary-pushing" wine samples define the hyperplane, making the model resilient to outliers or noise in the data.

Kernel Trick: Addresses non-linear relationships in wine data (e.g., between acidity and quality) by implicitly mapping features into a higher-dimensional space. The RBF kernel is common here, allowing complex, non-linear boundaries where linear separation isn't possible. Parameters like gamma (kernel flexibility) and C (misclassification penalty) are crucial.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimizing SVM performance requires careful tuning of parameters like C, kernel, gamma, and degree. This is achieved systematically:

GridSearchCV: Exhaustively searches a predefined grid of hyperparameter combinations, ensuring the best combination within that grid is found.

RandomizedSearchCV: Explores a random subset of parameter combinations from a given distribution, often more efficient for large search spaces.

Both methods leverage cross-validation to identify the optimal parameter set, crucial for training an SVM that accurately predicts wine quality on unseen data.
